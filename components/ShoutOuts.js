      Joe has put in an insane amount of work over the last 6 months. He has personally elevated Barker as a tool past my expectations. He really is gifted for having an appreciation of both what the user wants, as well as what the optimal way of working with back-end stack is, and I can tell this even from the product perspective because he is so good at breaking down concepts into understandable and actionable chunks. I am constantly and pleasantly surprised by the high level of ownership he has over anything he takes on. I consistently see him revisiting features that have released before, looking for either minor improvements to enact or to retest them for potential use cases he seems coming up as requirements and other features change, without any prompting from anyone else. He is an absolutely fantastic human being and thought partner to work with, and I have complete confidence in him. I also love that he has taken some of the new front end junior developers under his wing to mentor. He's also not afraid to call out the team on non-optimal procedures or decision-making that we may have taken recently but with the sole motivation for us to become better in the future. This one is especially tricky as itâ€™s an art to make sure one can critique without making it personal, but Joe has this soft skill to make it always within the broader goals of the team and never about any one person in particular.

    Joe is an invaluable member of the team who contributes greatly to Tesla's pricing product as well libraries used across the company. He has materialized the vision of barker becoming a truly self-serve tool, through integrating self-serve regression and approval via email to make it easier for execs to approve price changes. His passion for Tesla allows him to go above and beyond as demonstrated by him taking initiative to create a Tesla wide approval service adding value company wide.

      Joe's form library Informed has become an absolute lynchpin to my applications and I'm sure to many others. With that accomplishment, Joe has embraced the responsibility to be available to his users to fix issues and help them through complex use cases to an absolutely exemplary degree. No one else I've worked with at Tesla is as responsive or generous with their time, and this is a pretty high bar! Thanks, as always!

      Informed helps make taking care of state mostly thoughtless. I plug in a name for a field in the shape that I need and it just works. The few times I'm having issues the debug component and console tools make debugging a breeze and if that fails Joe is quick to tell me if it's user error or confirm a bug and fixes it nearly immediately. Great experience overall.

      Joe saw a conversation getting stressed and jumped in with humor to diffuse the situation. It helped everyone get a more level head and reengage for a more positive conclusion.

      To say that Joe has no quit would be an understatement. He understands what needs to be done and is skilled in finding the balance between what *must* be done vs. what *should* be done. Joe has the ability to be a huge guiding force in code quality and standards across the organization.

      Joe's work with React context form has been phenomenal. True to a library maintainer's ideals, he has provided great value, along with great support to consumers. His upgrades to rcf have never left a consumer stuck in a hard spot. Support for cjs along with esm is something he didn't have to do, but he still did, allowing consumers the right time to update their repos instead of enforcing it on them.
